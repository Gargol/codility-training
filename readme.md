Codility algorithms
===================

These are my solutions for codility algorithms which I do to keep my algorithmic skills sharp.

To run through any given task just look into a file and execute the `solution` function 
or if you find some tests for the problem in the folder run this:

```bash
npm install
tape /path/to/*.spec.js
```
